# Refactoring - A real case of a nested if structure transformed into a chain of responsibility
In this post I describe step by step a process used to transform 
a nested if structure into a chain of responsibility. 
The code used in this post is based on a real piece of code used to satisfy a real business need 
(we just removed the business related details).


## The need
It seemed a normal day of work when one of our managers called a meeting 
to inform us of a very urgent business need that should be put in production 
within 2 days.
So, as usually happens in this case, between the deriving chaos and the ton of alignment 
meetings that continuously interrupt us, 
we produced a code that basically "worked", but it was a bit chaotic. 
Luckily we were able at least to write the tests.
